# PowerCreator 🎓📊

**Turn studied content into beautiful PowerPoint presentations—automatically.**

## 🚀 What is PowerCreator?

PowerCreator is an LLM-powered tool that takes in URLs (articles, video transcripts, etc.), summarizes and combines their content, and transforms it into a well-designed PowerPoint presentation using Microsoft Designer.

Whether you're a student who’s studied hard and now needs slides fast, or just someone who hates building PowerPoints manually—this tool is for you.

## Why This Project?
This is part of my LLM Engineering mini-project series—where I explore how LLMs can solve practical problems and speed up real-life workflows.

I plan to build more tools like this and share them with the community. If you find this useful or have suggestions, feel free to contribute or reach out!
